# SegCodeNet  
**SegCodeNet** is an **Activity-Recognition** network that we propsed. The network is evaluated on first-person or ego-centric office video and surpassed the results of the state-of-the **Activity-Recognition** network [**I3d**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.07750.pdf). Details and code description about our work will be added soon. The details of our previous work on **Activity-Recognition** can be found [**here**].(https://deepai.org/publication/privacy-aware-activity-classification-from-first-person-office-videos?fbclid=IwAR04-dg5SkGKaha7XwTnIpP1m1YpMukT5Ga3QoU7aGZ7KVk5E4yDnXElPN8)
